I'm an atheist, but I'm not an atheist...

*   because it&#8217;s cool.
*   because of religious extremism or oppression in some depraved corners of the world.
*   because I don&#8217;t think evil can exist in a world with a god.
*   because I think Science can disprove God.


I'm an atheist because of one simple fact: THE BURDEN OF PROOF LIES ON RELIGION.

If you propose the existence of something, you must follow the scientific method in your defense of its existence. Otherwise I have no reason to listen to you.
