summary: 'How to download Windows 10 ISO without Media Creation Tool'
---
Microsoft released Windows 10 Fall update this week with a bunch of new minor features and bugfixes. It is running very good on my system. Reliable and Fast. Surprisingly the version is called Windows 10 version 1511 (not Windows 10.1 or 10 Update 1). The number represents 20**15** November (**11**). This is nice way of versioning operating systems as it tell you when was the update released. (The same way Canonical does it).

Anyways I had a problem before me as my University internet only allows 1GB per account and the update was upwards of 3GB so Windows Update would stall shortly. You can download the ISO using Media Creation Tool from <https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10ISO> but it cannot pause/resume downloads when my limit reached.

But when you visit this link in a mobile browser (or a desktop browser with User-Agent changed), you get a form which will ask you language and edition and provide you links for both 32-bit and 64-bit ISOs which are live for at least 24 hours. I just copied the link, added it to a Download accelerator and I was able to pause and resume downloads.

P.S.: The ISO counts at 3.74 GB for the 64-bit version.
