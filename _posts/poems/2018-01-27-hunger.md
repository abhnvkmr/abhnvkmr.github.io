Mama wolf counted -- One! Two! Three!  
Of her sons wailing under the fig tree  
Cries of hunger led her to yell  
Her cri de cœur was a fail  
No answer! From anyone in the pedigree  

Hunt was the hour of the need  
To forestall starvation of her just-born kid  
She roamed the woods  
For something, anything, but before dawn  
Had found a barn before her concede  

Unable to spot a herder after a sweep  
She counted: One sheep! Two sheep! Three sheep!  
She had singled out a lamb  
But her eyelids began to slam  
And she fell asleep
